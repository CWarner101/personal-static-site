        <p>
          Created a simple program that allows a user to play a simple cup guessing game with an accompanying gui. The player starts the game
          and the cups are shuffled on screen. They must they guess which cup a ball has been placed under. The game continues until the user 
          closes the program.

        <p>
          Created a simple static website used to help give people information on how to adopt dogs. This included information on why adoption is
          dog care advice, and locations near them.

        <p>
          For my Eagle Scout project, I built two outdoor libraries and a bench to go outside Portage West Middle School. I pre-stocked the 
          outdoor libraries with books, and the kids can take and leave books as they want. I built it in 2018, and it is still there and in 
          use to this day.
