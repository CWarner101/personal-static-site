        I don't have any direct experience in the field yet, but I do have multiple experiences working in fast 
        paced environments and in leadership roles. I have worked at Petco as both the Merchandising Operations Specialist 
        and assistant manager, so being in charge of team members and organization and familiar routines for me. I've also 
        done volunteer work through Twelve Baskets Food Pantry, and understand how hard work and efficiency can make a significant
