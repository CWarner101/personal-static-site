## Static Personal Django Site

This is a project that I worked on for a class about web applications and Django

## Author
Connor Warner


## Description

This site is comprised of 3 simple HTML pages. The first acts as an informal resume. The second explains projects that I had previously worked on at that time. The last page includes contact information for possible employer usage.


Tests simply act to ensure that the templates exist at the correct URL on a local host and that the content of the page exists on the proper page.

Settings for deployment through Heroku are also implemented.
